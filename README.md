HackUCI 2020 Project: Maze Game
Our project for HackUCI 2020

A Spongebob-themed three-dimensional maze.

The player plays as Patrick and can use eels to go down one level, escalators to go up one level, and elevators to go either up or down one level. The player wins by getting to Spongebob at the very top level.


This game is built on Python 3.7.
Required modules include numpy, pygame, and opency-python.

Use the up/down/right/left arrow keys to move horizontally.
The q key can be used to go upstairs and a to go down.
